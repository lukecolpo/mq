Fat manifests
=============

These are the fat manifests used by Docker Hub and Docker store to handle images with multiple CPU architectures.

They are used in conjunction with [manifest-tool](https://github.com/estesp/manifest-tool), for example:

```sh
manifest-tool push from-spec manifest-latest.yaml
```
